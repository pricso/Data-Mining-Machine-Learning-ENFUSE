# Data-Mining-Machine-Learning-ENFUSE

"ENFUSE matches local enterprises and social enterprises with teams of Masterâ€™s university / college students. During semester 2 (January-May) as part of a module, students work in teams of 4-6 members with selected enterprises. The students help provide insights, propose solutions and ultimately present a bespoke and tangible plan that sets out how the enterprise can innovate, address challenges and develop opportunities. Student teams present the plan to the enterprise to implement and to their module lecturer to assess. In addition, shortlisted student teams compete at the ENFUSE finals in May. The teams represent their university and compete by pitching to expert judges on the plan they created for their assigned enterprise."
